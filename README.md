### CSTMC.info

####Notes
please refers **[previously to my helper code](https://github.com/guinslym/cstmc_helper_to_parse_the_dataset)** that helped me parse the datasets

The website are hosted on Heroku. [www.cstmc.info](http://www.cstmc.info) or at [https://cstmc2015.herokuapp.com/](https://cstmc2015.herokuapp.com/). All the images are the original one, meaning that the images can be up to 12 mb so that's why when we do a query, the page is slow to render, but the query is pretty fast.



#Usage
	Mongodb (and Mongolabs add:on on heroku)
	rails 4.x

##installation
	bundle install
	rake db:create
	rake db:migrate
	rake db:seed
	guard
